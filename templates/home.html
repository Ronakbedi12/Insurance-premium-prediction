    <h2><u>Project Details</u></h2>
    <p><b>Insurance is the most effective risk management tool which can protect individuals and businesses from financial risks arising out of various contingencies. The emotional and psychological loss can never be compensated, but at least the financial loss can be compensated with insurance. Though there are uncertainties in life which you cannot mitigate, but insurance will surely help you transfer the financial risk associated with the same.</b></p>
